<h2>1. What did you do this past week?</h2>
This past week my partner and I worked quite a while on the second project,
Netflix, and finally finished it on Wednesday night.

<h2>2. What's in your way?</h2>
What's in my way is really trying to remember all of the little details of
Python that we have been going over in class.  With the test coming up in two
weeks I really need to start spending more time going over everything we do in
class in great detail.

<h2>3. What will you do next week?</h2>
This next week I will start preparing myself a bit for the upcoming test and
start thinking about who I want to work with in a group for the next three
projects.

<h2>Experience</h2>
After this past project, I have started to really value partner programming.
We were not in the same section of class, but we have worked together in the
past on projects, but they were group projects, so it was nice just working as
the two of us.

<h2>Tip</h2>
After using my terminal this past week so much for the Netflix project, I
decided it was about time to spiff it up.  In my hunt to do so, I came across
[this article](http://osxdaily.com/2013/02/05/improve-terminal-appearance-mac-os-x/)
to do just the trick!  It is nothing too fancy or impressive, but it makes the
terminal a little more fun to look at when using!
