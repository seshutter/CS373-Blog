<h2>1. What did you do this past week?</h2>
This past week of class we finished going over SQL. We went over aggregation,
insert, delete, and update. We then moved to Java! We are going over how to
refactor code in Java, based on example code from the book Refactoring:
Improving the Design of Existing Code.

<h2>2. What's in your way?</h2>
Getting project 5, IDB3 done so that I can start studying for our second test in
class.

<h2>3. What will you do next week?</h2>
This next week my group and I will get to work on IDB3 and hopefully get it all
completed before Thursday.

<h2>Experience</h2>
As we start to go over the refactoring example, I realize not only how beneficial
refactoring and cleaning up your code is, but how much thought must go into it.
Each decision you take to clean up your code must be well thought out, and takes
many steps to get it to where it needs to be.

<h2>Tip</h2>
