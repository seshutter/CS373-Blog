<h2>1. What did you do this past week?</h2>
This past week my group and I worked on IDB1 and finished and turned it in
Thursday night.  It was quite a lot of work to make it all finally come together
to finish it up and turn it in.  Even though we were not the most satisfied with
what we turned in, we did get it done and turned in on time.  In class we started
learning about relational algebras.  We learned about the functions select and
project, and then about cross join, theta join, and natural join.

<h2>2. What's in your way?</h2>
Staying on top of my work.  Along with our IDB projects, I also have projects due
every two weeks, following in the same week, as when the IDB projects are due.  
Therefore, I just need to make sure that I stay focused and get as much done
ahead of time as possible so we are not frantically turning it again at the last
minute like we did for the first one.

<h2>3. What will you do next week?</h2>
This next week we will start to work on IDB2 and get phase 2 going and make sure
we are getting stuff done as soon as possible.

<h2>Experience</h2>
Turning in the first phase of the IDB projects, I have really enjoyed my time
working on this project.  It is really cool to work in a bigger group, five people,
where everyone really does care about the project and how our product looks.  
Everyone is willing to contribute and actually help out and meet when we need to
which is a nice feeling, rather than just a few of us do the whole thing while
others are not contributing at all.  I also think this is a really cool project
and it is nice being able to be as creative as we want with it.

<h2>Tip</h2>

For my tip this week, I think it's a great reminder to watch this video and see
why being in Computer Science is so worth it.  It is rewarding and there are so
many things you can do with coding knowledge.  No matter what you want to do,
knowing how to code is really an advantage, and I think this video by code.org
really captures that.
